# Fisher-linear-discriminant
NYCU, Pattern Recognition, homework2

This project is to implement Fisherâ€™s linear discriminant by using only NumPy.

The sample code can be download in this [link](https://github.com/NCTU-VRDL/CS_AT0828/tree/main/HW2).

## Requirement
In this work, you can use following command to build the environment.

```bash
$ conda create --name PR python=3.8 -y
$ conda activate PR
$ conda install matplotlib pandas -y
```
## Find Closed Form Solution & Evaluate
You can use the following command to find the best parameters, and program will automatically generate the evaluation result.

```bash
python 310551031_HW2.py
```

## Result

This argument can achieves 0.9 on testing data.
